#Description
I built this schedule app  in order to help users keep track of their work day. The application presents the user with . I used HTML, CSS & JavaScript to build this application.
#Usage
In order to use app, follow the link and the user will be presented with a calendar witht the month, day and year being dynamically generated by day.js. Below the current date is is a hourly calendar for the work day. This calendar will allow users to input text in the text area. This text will be saved to local storage when the user clicks the save button. The user can then refresh the page and will see that the entered text has persisted from local storage. The app will also display the day with a past, present, future function which will update the text area color based on the current time. 
#Contributions
During the development of this app I had help from my  tutor Corey Yates. When faced with a challenge in the development of this app I looked through posts on stackoverflow as well as utilizing the Ed Ex Expert app and GitHub copilot to look for problems in my code.
